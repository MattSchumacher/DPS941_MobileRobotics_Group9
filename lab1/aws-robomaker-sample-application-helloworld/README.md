### Q1: Do you think ROS is beneficial for developing a robotic application? Explain your answer.
In my opinion, ROS is very beneficial in the development of a robotic application. It provides the frameworks and libraries that enable the production of code for robots. It allows for developers to use a centralized coding language that is easily understandable, and gives the opportunity to quickly develop your code, and test it out with other software such as AWS robomaker, which gives the ability to simulate our ROS code in a virtual environment to see how our robot reacts to our code changes.
### Q2: Why is using a simulator important in Robotics? 
Using a simulator is important in Robotics because it allows us to test and develop well working code, in a place that can be entirely controlled by us, the developers. As simple as testing how a robot would turn and move forward in a quickly controlled environment allows us develops to create working code. In the case of developing code in very complex environments, or otherwise costly environments, we would have to be very careful to execute working code, since the actual robot is expensive, and we wouldnâ€™t want to break it. This is when a simulator for Robotics comes in handy. We can mess around with the robot for hours in a virtual environment, without the thought of breaking it. On top of that, code that works in an virtual environments, such as a simulator, we are almost guaranteed that the code will perfectly execute in a real world scenario.
### Q3: Briefly describe the RoboMaker platform. Also, list its strength and weak points in your personal opinion.
The RoboMaker platform allows us to create robotic applications. It is a development environment that works with Amazons AWS service, which grants the ability to have other different types monitoring and analytical services. It gives the developers the ability to develop code for a robot and test it immediately in a controlled virtual environment. Some strengths of RoboMaker include the ability to test any code in any environment that a robot can work within. Another strength is the ability to quickly develop code and be able to deploy it for testing in no time. Another great strength of the RoboMaker application is that it is being run on AWS, which is one of the best cloud services available to developers. A weak point of the RoboMaker platform, is that it is being run on an AWS virtual machine, which introduces a lot of latency and lag. Although it is not program breaking, it can be annoying to see your robot moving every 2 frames per second, which is not ideal. Other than that, RoboMaker is a very strong and intensive application that gives developers the ability to create Robots that can be applied to the real world, with little to no errors.
