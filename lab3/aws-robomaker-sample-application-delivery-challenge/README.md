## Matt's Reflection:
### Q1: What is autonomous navigation in mobile robotics?

### Q2: What parameters does the robot navigation algorithm consider when planning a path? 

### Q3: What is a cost map (in the context of autonomous navigation).

### Q4: What is inflation radius (in the context of autonomous navigation).

### Q5: Which navigation paramters did you tune using the document in the link below?
