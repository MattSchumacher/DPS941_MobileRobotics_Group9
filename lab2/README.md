### Q1: What is mapping in autonomous robotics?
Mapping is the process of understanding an environment for a robot. When robots navigate, they are continuously building a map of its surroundings. This allows for robots to be familiar with the setting they are in, which will enable them to safely navigate autonomously.
### Q2: How important is the map’s accuracy for the robot’s autonomous navigation task? 
The map’s accuracy is very important for a robot. If a robot is placed into an environment that it is unfamiliar with, it can cause it to make certain mistakes whilst navigating, which can be crucial to the success of the robot.
### Q3: What are dynamic objects in autonomous robotics? Either explain or provide some examples.
Dynamic objects in autonomous robotics refers to objects that are going to be in motion in an environment. An example would be another robot navigating within the same environment, or as we can think of a video game, where guards patrol within a certain area. These objects are not static, meaning that they are almost constantly in motion.
### Q4: Should the dynamic objects be present when mapping an arena? Explain the reason for your answer.
When mapping an arena, the dynamic objects do not need to be present. The reason as to why they do not need to be, is because if the robot has already mapped out the “static” parts of the environment. When it is navigating, it tries to keep itself centered and a certain distance away from the walls. So, when it is navigating to a specific coordinate within a map, if it detects a moving object approaching the robot, it will navigate away from it, but also navigate away from a wall.
